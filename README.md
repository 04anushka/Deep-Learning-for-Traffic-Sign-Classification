## Dataset
The project uses the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) dataset, which contains over 50,000 images of traffic signs categorized into 43 classes.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model is designed with the following layers:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions to minimize computational cost.
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine features and classify the images.

The architecture is optimized for accurate traffic sign classification.
